I used to be a <abbr title="People who design mobile games">mobile Game Designer</abbr>, but I don't write code, I only responsible for the functions design. I come here to study <em>Interactive Media Design</em> because I want to improve my understanding of design and learn some usefull design skills, so that I can go further or even change my creer in my 30<sup>th</sup>. My favourite saying is <blockquote>Live to learn - <cite>Solon</cite></blockquote></p>
            <p>I like RV travelling. I designed and rebuilt a RV with my girlfriend when I was in Shanghai. The happiest time for us is driving the car and travelling around the country. We like taking photos of beautifull scenery and shooting videos recording the life styles of different places. <mark>If it is possible, I want to design and build a RV here and drive it to travel American continent.</mark></p>
