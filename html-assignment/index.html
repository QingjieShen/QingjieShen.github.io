I come here to study <em>Interactive Media Design</em> to enhance my understanding of design and acquire usefull design skills that will help me further my career or even make a creer change in my 30<sup>th</sup>. My favourite quote is</p> <blockquote>Live to learn - <cite>Solon</cite></blockquote>
            <p>I like RV travelling. I designed and renovated a RV with my girlfriend when I was in Shanghai. Our happiest moments are spent behind the wheel, exploring new destinations and capturing the beauty of the scenery through photography and videography. <mark>My dream is to design and build a new RV here in Canada and embark on a journey to discover the American continent.</mark></p>
