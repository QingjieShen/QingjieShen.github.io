            <p>I like RV travelling. I designed and rebuilt a RV with my girlfriend when I was in Shanghai. The happiest time for us is driving the car and travelling around the country. We like taking photos of beautifull scenery and shooting videos recording the life styles of different places. <mark>If it is possible, I want to design and build a RV here and drive it to travel American continent.</mark></p>
